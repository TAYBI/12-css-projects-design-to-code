            <p>
              Projects are represented as boards in the system. Along with
              displaying essential information about the project, they can be
              set to public or private, depending on the userâ€™s preferences.

            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <p>
              Tasks and subtasks are the smallest chunks of executable
              assignments. Tasks can be assigned to multiple users, given a
              priority and easily moved across different states in the
              development pipeline.

            <p>
              Users invited to work together with the common goal of delivering
              a successful project. They can have several different roles as
              active members of the development, or simply followers of the
              board.

            <p>
              The time tracking feature enables the users to easily measure the
              time spent on a specific task. Once tracked and logged, the time
              can be seen and edited in a dedicated Time Records view for
              additional control.
